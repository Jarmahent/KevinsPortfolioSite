# KevinsPortfolioSite
This is the code behind (what will be) http://myportfolio.nanoapp.io/



## This website was first written in Flask, V1.0.2. 

I decided to move over to Django because I was thinking of add a bunch of new features to the website, its much faster to do this
on Django than on Flask because of its built in features such as Form control, Admin Pages, and Database support.
